🐍 Basic Python Projects

This repository contains basic Python projects created to practice core Python concepts like functions, conditionals, loops, and user input and soon 

📁 Projects Included
🎯 1. Number Guessing Game

File: number_guessing_game.py

📌 Description

A simple command-line game where the computer selects a random number and the user tries to guess it.

🔧 Concepts Used

 -> Random number generation

 ->Loops

 ->Conditional statements

 -> User input

 -> Basic logic building

▶ How It Works

The program generates a random number.

The user guesses the number.

The program gives hints (too high / too low).

The game ends when the correct number is guessed.

🏦 2. Simple Banking Application

File: Simple_banking_application.py

📌 Description

A command-line banking application built using Python functions.
It allows users to perform basic banking operations while handling all input conditions safely.

🔧 Functions Used

check_balance() → Displays current account balance

deposit_amount(amount) → Deposits a valid amount into the account

withdraw_amount(amount) → Withdraws money after checking balance

update_kyc() → Updates KYC status

check_kyc() → Checks whether KYC is completed

⚙ Features & Conditions Handled

✔ Ensures numeric input for amount
✔ Prevents negative or zero deposits
✔ Checks sufficient balance before withdrawal
✔ Restricts withdrawal if KYC is not updated
✔ Handles invalid menu choices
✔ Uses functions for modular and clean code

▶ How It Works

User selects an operation from the menu

Input is validated before processing

Appropriate function is called

Errors are handled gracefully with messages

🧠 Concepts Used

Functions & function calls

Conditional statements

Input validation

Global/local variables

Menu-driven program design

🌱 Learning Outcome
